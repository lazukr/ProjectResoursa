# file that includes all the properties of materials
# 
# HOW TO USE:
# -------------
# Begin the line with '$' if you wish for that line to be detected as a property key.
#
# The left side of a property key should ideally be a character, if you surpass the 
# 26 letters of the alphabet, you can just make it 2 characters. No spaces permitted.
# The left side acts as a mapping for the table that can be found below.
# The right side of the property key should ideally be a useful descriptor to that property
# as it will be read and used by the classes in material.py.
# Similar properties should ideally be placed on the same line.
# 
# The data placed in the table are not permitted to have spaces. It should also either consist
# of a valid value (integer or decimal) or a valid tuple.
